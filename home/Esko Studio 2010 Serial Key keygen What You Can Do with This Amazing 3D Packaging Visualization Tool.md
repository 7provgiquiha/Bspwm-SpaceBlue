These devices allow you to rotate the material along a cylindrical axis while cutting it with a tool. You can use the setup functions in the software to define the parameters of your rotary part, such as the diameter and length, and see how the toolpaths will look like when wrapped around the cylinder in the 3D view. This feature is useful for designing and cutting projects that have curved or spiral shapes, such as fluted columns and barley twists. You can also use it to engrave text or patterns on round projects. Note: This feature does not create new toolpaths, but rather transforms existing 3 axis toolpaths by replacing one of the linear axis with the rotary axis.
  
To use the Wrapped Rotary Axis Toolpath postprocessing feature, you need to have a CNC machine that supports rotary axis or rotary indexer setups. A rotary axis is a device that rotates the material along a cylindrical axis while the tool moves in the X and Y directions. A rotary indexer is a device that rotates the material to a fixed angle and then stops while the tool moves in the X, Y and Z directions. Both devices allow you to cut complex shapes on round projects.

The software allows you to create toolpaths for your rotary part using standard 3 axis toolpath types, such as profile, pocket, v-carve, texture and so on. You can also import 3D models and create 3D toolpaths for them. After creating the toolpaths, you can use the Wrapped Rotary Axis Toolpath postprocessing feature to transform them into rotary toolpaths. You can access this feature from the Toolpaths menu or by clicking on the icon in the Toolpaths tab.
  
When you use this feature, you need to specify the parameters of your rotary part, such as the diameter, length and orientation of the cylinder. You also need to choose which linear axis will be replaced by the rotary axis. The software will then wrap the toolpaths around the cylinder and display them in the 3D view. You can preview the toolpaths and check for any errors or collisions. You can also adjust the settings of the toolpaths, such as the feed rate, spindle speed and stepover. When you are satisfied with the results, you can save the toolpaths as a file that can be run on your CNC machine.

The Wrapped Rotary Axis Toolpath postprocessing feature can be used for a variety of projects that require cutting or engraving on round materials. For example, you can use it to create fluted columns, which are columns that have vertical grooves along their surface. To create a fluted column, you need to draw a profile of the groove shape and create a profile toolpath for it. Then you can use the Wrapped Rotary Axis Toolpath postprocessing feature to wrap the toolpath around the cylinder and cut the grooves on the column.
  
Another example of a project that can be done with this feature is a barley twist, which is a spiral shape that can be used as a decorative element on furniture or other objects. To create a barley twist, you need to import a 3D model of the spiral shape and create a 3D toolpath for it. Then you can use the Wrapped Rotary Axis Toolpath postprocessing feature to wrap the toolpath around the cylinder and cut the spiral shape on the material.
  
You can also use this feature to engrave text or patterns on round projects, such as cups, bowls, vases and so on. To do this, you need to draw or import the text or pattern and create a v-carve or texture toolpath for it. Then you can use the Wrapped Rotary Axis Toolpath postprocessing feature to wrap the toolpath around the cylinder and engrave the text or pattern on the project.
