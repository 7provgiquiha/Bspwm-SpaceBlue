# Review of Structure of Materials: An Introduction to Crystallography, Diffraction and Symmetry by Marc De Graef and Michael E. McHenry
 
Structure of Materials: An Introduction to Crystallography, Diffraction and Symmetry is a popular textbook for upper undergraduates and graduates in materials science and engineering, physics and chemistry. It covers the fundamentals of crystallography and symmetry, applying these concepts to a large range of materials, from metals and ceramics to molecular solids and biological materials. The second edition of this book, published in 2012 by Cambridge University Press[^1^], has been updated with more streamlined coverage of crystallography, additional coverage of magnetic point group symmetry and extraterrestrial minerals and rocks, and over 500 additional exercises available online with a solutions manual[^2^]. The book also features over 400 illustrations that help students visualise crystal structures and more abstract mathematical objects, as well as historical and biographical sections that add colour and interest to the field.

The book is divided into four parts: Part I introduces materials and material properties, the periodic table of the elements and interatomic bonds, crystal structures, crystallographic computations, lattice planes, reciprocal space and symmetry in crystallography. Part II focuses on point groups, plane groups and space groups, non-crystallographic point groups, periodic and aperiodic tilings, simple derivative and superlattice structures, complex geometrically determined structures and quasicrystals. Part III discusses diffraction techniques, such as X-ray, neutron and electron diffraction, as well as the relationship between crystal structures and diffraction patterns. Part IV explores various types of materials, such as amorphous metals, basic structure prototypes, high-temperature superconductors, terrestrial and extraterrestrial minerals and rocks, molecular solids and biological materials.
 
The book is well-written, comprehensive and rigorous, covering both theoretical and practical aspects of crystallography and symmetry. It is suitable for students who have some background in mathematics, physics and chemistry, but also provides clear explanations and examples for those who are less familiar with these subjects. The book is also useful for instructors who can access a password-protected solutions manual online[^2^], as well as Powerpoints of figures from the book[^1^]. The book has received positive reviews from readers who praised its clarity, depth and relevance to modern materials science[^3^].
 
Structure of Materials: An Introduction to Crystallography, Diffraction and Symmetry is a top rated textbook that provides a solid foundation for understanding the structure of materials at different scales. It is highly recommended for anyone who wants to learn more about this fascinating topic.

One of the strengths of this book is its emphasis on symmetry, which is a fundamental concept in crystallography and materials science. Symmetry describes the invariance of an object or a pattern under certain transformations, such as rotation, reflection or translation. Symmetry can be used to classify crystal structures, to simplify crystallographic computations, to determine the possible diffraction patterns and to predict the physical properties of materials. The book introduces the mathematical tools and notation for describing symmetry, such as matrices, vectors, groups and tensors, and shows how they can be applied to various types of materials. The book also explains the concept of symmetry breaking, which occurs when a material undergoes a phase transition or a deformation that reduces its symmetry.
 
Another strength of this book is its breadth and diversity of materials that are discussed and illustrated. The book covers both traditional and modern materials, from metals and ceramics that have periodic crystal structures, to quasicrystals and amorphous metals that have aperiodic or non-crystalline structures. The book also covers molecular solids and biological materials, such as DNA, proteins and viruses, that have complex and hierarchical structures. The book shows how the structure of materials can be determined by various diffraction techniques, such as X-ray, neutron and electron diffraction, and how the structure affects the physical and chemical properties of materials, such as electrical conductivity, magnetism, optical activity and mechanical strength. The book also includes examples of extraterrestrial minerals and rocks that have been discovered by space missions, such as meteorites, lunar samples and Martian rocks.
