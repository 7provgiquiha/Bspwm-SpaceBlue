One of the preventive measures you can take is to clean or replace the waste ink pad regularly. The waste ink pad is a sponge-like component that absorbs the excess ink that is ejected from the print head during cleaning cycles. Over time, the waste ink pad can become saturated and cause ink leakage or overflow. To avoid this, you should check the condition of the waste ink pad periodically and replace it when it is full. You can buy a new waste ink pad from an authorized EPSON dealer or service center.
 
Another preventive measure you can take is to install an external waste ink tank. An external waste ink tank is a device that collects the waste ink from your printer and stores it in a separate container. This way, you can avoid filling up the waste ink pad and prevent ink leakage or overflow. You can buy an external waste ink tank from online retailers or make your own using some simple materials. You can find many tutorials and videos on how to install an external waste ink tank on your EPSON printer online.
